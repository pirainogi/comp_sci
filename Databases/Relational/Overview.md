- ACID compliant
- RDBMS (*relational database management system*) is more common and better understood than noSQL
  - standards are well-defined and commonly accepted
- Emerged in the 70’s to store data according to a schema that allows data to be displayed as tables with rows and columns
- provides functionality for reading, creating, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data
  - typically by means of SQL (structured query language) statements
- tables have keys associated with specific columns or rows and facilitate faster access to particular pieces of data
- data reliability and accuracy is a prime concern with RDBMS
  - unstructured or semi-structured data isn’t best use case for RDBMS due to type constraints and schemas
  - ill-suited for large analytics or IoT event loads
  - tables may not map one-to-one with an object or class representing the same data
  - schemas and types must be (close to) identical between source and destination tables for  migrations to work
