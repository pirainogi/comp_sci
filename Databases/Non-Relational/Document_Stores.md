- Schema-free systems that store data in the form of JSON Objects
- Similar to key-value or wide column stores but the document name is the key and the contents of the  document are the value
- Individual records do not require a  uniform structure
  - can contain different value types
  - can be nested 
- Well-suited to manage semi-structured data across distributed systems

## Common Examples
- MongoDB
- Couchbase
