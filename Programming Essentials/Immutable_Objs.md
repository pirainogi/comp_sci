- In OO and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after itâ€™s created
- Mutable objects can have their fields changed after construction, while mutable objects cannot

#### Why use them?
- Simpler to construct, test and use;
- always thread-safe
- avoid temporal coupling
- usage is side-effect free (no defensive copies)
- identity mutability problem is avoided
- they always have failure atomicity
