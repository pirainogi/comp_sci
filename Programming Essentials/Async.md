# Async
- allows multiple things to happen at the same time.
  - When you start an action, your program continues to run.
  - When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets the result
- Central part of a computer that carries out the individual steps that make up programs is called the processor
  - The speed at which something like a loop that manipulates numbers can be executed depends pretty much entirely on the speed of the processor
- Many programs interact with things outside of the processor
  - for example network requests
- JavaScript doesnâ€™t let the processor sit their idly while the program interacts with the network, and this is the asynchronous programming model
