## Client Side
- Code that is run on the client’s computer
  - Downloaded, run, and then displayed in the browser
  - Includes Javascript
- Content is entering the HTML file via JavaScript
  - instead of getting all of the content from the HTML document itself, it’s just barebones HTML with a JS file that will render the rest of the site using the browser
- Faster
  - Don’t have to load the entire site upon page load
  - Only load what’s relevant at the current moment
- Not as good for SEO though
  - an HTML file that’s all-inclusive is easier to scrape

### Pros of Client-Side
- Rich site interactions
- Fast website rendering after the initial load
- Great for web apps
- Robust selection of JS libs

### Cons of Client-Side
- Low SEO if not implemented correctly
- Initial load might require more time
- Requires a library (in most cases)

## Server Side
- Code run on the server
  - Results are downloaded and displayed in the browser
  - PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET, and JS via Node

  - Converts HTML files in the server into information for the browser
  - When you visit a website, your browser makes a request to the server that contains the contents of the website
  - Once your request is done processing, your browser gets back the rendered HTML and displays it on screen
  - Have to reload the entire page every single time you want an action performed or the contents of the web page changed

### Pros
- SEO
- Initial page load is faster
- great for static sites

### Cons
- Frequent server requests
- Slow page rendering
- Full page reloads
- Non-rich site interactions
