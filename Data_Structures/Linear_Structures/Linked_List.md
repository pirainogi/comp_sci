# Singly-Linked List 
- what are they 
  - sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other node also containing data 
  - last node points to null 
- where are they used 
  - list, queue, stack 
  - creating circular lists 
  - easily model real world objects (train)
  - separate chaining (hashtable implementation), hashing collisions 
  - implmentation of adjacency lists for graphs 
- terminology 
  - head 
    - first node in a list 
  - tail 
    - last node in a list 
  - pointer 
    - reference to another node 
  - node 
    - object containing data 
- singly 
  - only hold a reference to the next node 
  - always maintain a reference to the head and a reference to the tail for quick additions/removals 
  - pros
    - uses less memory
    - simpler implementation 
  - cons 
    - cannot easily access previous elements 
- implementation (insertion/removal)
  - insertion
    - traverse to the correct position 
    - create new node 
    - point new node to next node 
    - point current node to new node 
  - removal 
    - create 2 pointers (head and head+one)
    - advance 2nd pointer to node to remove and 1st pointer to node before it 
    - create temp pointer to point to node to remove 
    - advance 2nd pointer to node after node to remove 
    - point 1st pointer node to 2nd pointer node 
    - remove node (garbage collection)
- complexity 
  - search - O(n)
  - insert at head - O(1)
  - insert at tail - 0(1)
