# Priority Queues 
- what is a priority queue 
  - abstract data type 
  - operates similar to a normal queue but elements have a priority 
  - elements with higher priority are dequeued first 
  - only supports comparable data 
    - data inserted into the PQ must be able to be ordered in some way (either least to greatest or greatest to least)
    - need to be able to assign relative priorities to each element 
  - only guaranteed that next number in sequence is smallest of the current queue 
- what is a heap 
  - tree based data structure that satisfies the heap invariant (heap property): if a is a parent node of b, then a is ordered with respect to be for all nodes a, b in the heap 
  - binary heaps 
    - binary tree that supports the heap invariant 
    - two children for all parents 
    - complete binary tree is a tree in which at every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled and all possible nodes as far left as possible 
      - gives us an insertion point 
    - binary heap representation (array)
    ![binary heap representation with array]()
      - insertion position is the last position in the array 
  - binomial heaps 
    - any number of child branches 
  - max heap 
    - parent is greater than all children 
  - min heap 
    - parent is less than all children 
- when/where to use a priority queue 
  - use in certain implementations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
  - anytime you need to dynamically fetch the 'next best' or 'next worse' element 
  - used in huffman coding (lossless data compression)
  - best first search algos 
    - use PQs to continuously grab the next most promising node 
    - minimum spanning tree algorithms 
- how to turn a min priority queue into a max priority queue 
  - problem: most programming languages only provide min PQ but we might need a max PQ 
  - since elements in a PQ are comparable, they implement some sort of comparable interface which we can negate to achieve a max heap 
    - with numbers 
      - let x and y be numbers in the PQ 
      - for a min PQ, if x <= y, x comes out of the PQ before y 
      - negation is x >= y, then y comes out before x 
      - alternative: negate the number as you insert them into the PQ 
        - negate them again when they are taken out 
    - with strings 
      - lex is a comparator for strings which sorts them into lexicographic order 
      - let nlex be the negation of lex 
        - if s1 < s2 => -1 
          - nlex -(-1) => 1 
        - if s1 = s2 => 0 
          - nlex -(0) => 0 
        - if s1 > s2 => 1 
          - nlex -(1) => -1 
- complexity analysis 
  - binary heap construction O(n)
    - heap sort 
  - polling O(log(n))
  - peeking O(1)
  - adding O(log(n))
  - removing (naive) O(n)
    - linear scan and then remove 
  - advanced removing with hash table O(log(n))
  - naive contains O(n)
  - contains check with hash table O(1)
- binary heap priority queue implementation details 
  - heap sinking/swimming (sift down/up or bubble up/down)
    - heaps give us the best possible time complexity 
    - we could also use an unordered list for the same behavior but worse time complexity 
  - adding elements to a priority queue 
  - removing elements from a priority queue 
- implementation
