- Upper bound of the complexity in the worst case 
- Quantify performance as the input size gets arbitrarily large 
- ignore constants and multiplicative factors 

- Constant Time O(1)
    - one piece of work 
    - one loop that isn't reliant upon n 
- Logarithmic Time O(log(n))
    - binary search 
- Linear Time O(n)
    - loop reliant upon n, doing n amount of work 
- Linearithmic Time O(nlog(n))
    - mergesort 
- Quadratic Time O(n^2)
    - n amount of work n times (loop in a loop)
- Cubic Time O(n^3)
- Exponential Time O(b^n) b > 1 
    - finding all subsets of a set o(2^n)
