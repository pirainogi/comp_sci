# Binary Search Tree
* nodes to the left are smaller in value
* nodes to the right are larger in value
* O(log n) time on average and O(n) in the worst case to search through a BST
  * faster on insertions and deletions
  * rely on the tree being balanced
* no random access

## Red-Black Tree
* self balancing tree
