* important to pick features that directly relate to what you're recommending (convert an item into numbers that can be compared)
* features shouldn't have bias

* Classification: categorization into a group
* Regression: predicting a response

* cosine similarity: compares the angles of two vectors

# Machine Learning
* train a computer to do a specific task
* OCR: optical character recognition
  * measure lines, points, and curves
